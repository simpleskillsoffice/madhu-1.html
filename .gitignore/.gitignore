			I saw some Burma shave style signs on the side of the 
		road today:"passing cars, When you can't see, May get 
		you, A glimpse, of eternity." I definitely won't be passing 
		any cars.

			My First day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got 
			everything packed and ready to go.Because I'm on a segway,
			I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone , ipod, 
			digital camera, and a protein bar . Just the essentials . As 
			Lao tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one segway."
